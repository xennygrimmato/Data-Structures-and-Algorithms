# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
Data structures and algorithms play in important role in computer science.
A collection of some implementations of data structures and algorithms, primarily for competitive programming.

Hello, world! This effort is directed towards making a compilation of some interesting data structures and algorithms, for the community to learn, collaborate and refer whenever required.

In the coming months, I hope to have a variety of data structures and algorithms here.

Feel free to create PRs and issues on the repo.
